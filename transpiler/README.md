# Graphite Transpiler
This compiles all the Carbon code into Luau-readable code so it can be understood by the Roblox client.

## Directory Helper
- ``/lib``: Import into your Carbon codebase. Includes all the libraries you need.
- ``/transpiler``: Will actually convert your Carbon code into Luau.

## Luau
Luau is Roblox's implementation of Lua 5.1. The source is avaliable [here](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau).

> Luau (lowercase u, /ˈlu.aʊ/) is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed embeddable scripting language derived from Lua.
